## ðŸš€ How It Works

The banner system uses Python's `random.choice()` to select a different color scheme each time you run Sud0Recon. Each theme includes:

- **Main Colors**: 3 gradient colors for the ASCII art
- **Accent Color**: For highlights and special text
- **Border Color**: For the panel border
- **Theme Name**: Displayed subtly in the banner

## ðŸ›  Technical Details

The banner is built using the Rich library for beautiful terminal formatting:
- Unicode block characters for clean ASCII art
- Rich color styling with 256-color and RGB support
- Panel component with dynamic borders
- Text formatting with emojis and styling

## ðŸ“‹ Usage

Simply run Sud0Recon normally - the banner appears automatically:

```bash
# Each run will show a different theme
sud0recon --version
sud0recon -t example.com
sud0recon --help
```

## ðŸŽª Demo Script

Run the banner demo to see all themes:

```bash

This will cycle through all 8 themes so you can see them all in action!
